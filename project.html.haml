    %h2 Powerful VFS
    :markdown
      UberFire has the power of GIT built in. A simple and clean NIO.2 based Virtual File System, using JGIT, ensures consistent APIs for both client and server. Supports change tracking and includes a metadata engine, full-text search, and security integration.

    %h2 Native Plugin System
    :markdown
      Develop plugins in Java against our declarative, typesafe APIs, or choose your favorite JavaScript framework and develop using that. Plugins can contribute new perspectives, views, editors, menu items, and more to an UberFire project.

    %h2 Ready For Clustering

      UberFire works flawlessly in clustered and highly-available deployments. GIT allows for a decentralised cluster, with efficient binary replication of content between nodes. Enjoy HA out-of-the-box: load balancing and failover just work!
